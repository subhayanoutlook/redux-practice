Details
There are 4 cards. Each one has a message (which indicates their positions) and 3 buttons.
On Click of a button the message of the card should change to that buttonâ€™s name. Ex: On Clicking Button A in Left Top Card, Message Left Top should change to Button A.
Every time there is a button click message should change. Ex: After the message has changed to Button A in the Left Top Card, again if Button B is clicked, the message should change to Button B.
Along with the message changes in their own cards, following functionalities should also be achieved: -
On clicking any button in the Left Down Card, messages in both Left Top and Left Down Card should change simultaneously.
On clicking any button in the Right Top Card, messages in Left Top, Left Down and Right Top Card should change simultaneously.
On clicking any button in the Right Down Card, messages in all Cards should change simultaneously.
Optional: Add a Reset button below all the Cards. On clicking the Reset button, starting messages should be restored.
